# Custom Enumerable Project

Repository from the Ruby Course of The Odin Project [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables). The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. This project will also familiarize you with how to work with blocks and procs. Some starter code and specs are provided to validate the correctness of your solutions.

P.S. I took the tests from [crespire](https://github.com/crespire/ruby_custom_enumberables/blob/main/tests.rb) and modified them for some methods to work with Hashes.

### Methods

The following table has the methods you will need to implement along with their associated specs, as outlined in the project instructions. The methods in the Enumerable module only need to work with Arrays, but you can challenge yourself and try to make them work for Hashes as well.
